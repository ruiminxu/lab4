# lab4

In this lab:

I added a queue to read in the .csv file and will remove each remove from the front once file is read.

I use created object class for song and artist to hold information read from .csv.

Also, have a queue on playlist which holds Song object.

Also, a linked list of songhistory filled with Song object.
